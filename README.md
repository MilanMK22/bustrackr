# BusTrackr

BusTrackr is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding out when the next 5 buses are arriving at bus stops in Wellington.

## Purpose

The motivation behind creating BusTrackr stemmed from the need to efficiently track bus schedules for daily commutes. Often, existing apps such as the Metlink application offer a plethora of features and complexities, which might overwhelm users seeking a straightforward solution. BusTrackr aims to streamline this process by providing users with a clear view of the next buses arriving at their preferred stops.

## Functionality

BusTrackr caters to individuals familiar with their daily bus stop number and commute duration. By inputting the bus stop number into the search bar, users gain access to information about the upcoming 5 buses along with their estimated arrival times. This allows users to plan their departure from home accordingly.
